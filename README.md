## Chudnovsky Algorithm for Pi Calculation

The Chudnovsky algorithm is a highly efficient and precise method for calculating Pi. This implementation allows for calculating Pi as a fraction, which can then be converted to its decimal representation as required.

### Steps to Use the Chudnovsky Algorithm

1. Choose the menu option for Pi computation.
2. Enter the desired number of terms for the calculation. Increasing the number of terms will increase the accuracy but will also require more computational resources.
3. Optionally, the resulting value of Pi can be output to a file in its decimal form.

## Performance and Precision

- High-precision arithmetic and large integer calculations are computationally intensive.
